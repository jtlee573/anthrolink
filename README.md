Phased Antenna Arrays and Applications in Wireless Connectivity.

Composed of
* RF Detection System 
* RF Switch
* Phased Antenna Array

RF Detector consists of a matching network, half-bridge rectifier, and microcontroller unit.
DC output is compared with a defined voltage threshold, subsequently triggering a response by driving an external LED.
